# Game-Client-Management-System
A DBMS project.
Title: Game Distribution Platform Database Management System (DBMS) Project

## Introduction
This project aims to design and implement a Database Management System (DBMS) for a game distribution platform. The platform provides a wide range of games to its users and manages various aspects such as game information, purchases, receipts, user accounts, developer details, and genre types. The DBMS will facilitate efficient data storage, retrieval, and management to support the platform's operations and enhance user experiences.

## Database Schema
The database schema comprises several tables to organize and represent different entities within the game distribution platform. One of the core tables is the "Game Catalogue" table, which stores information about the games available on the platform. The attributes of this table include:

- **Game ID**: A unique identifier for each game.
- **Title**: The title or name of the game.
- **Description**: A brief description of the game, providing an overview of its gameplay or storyline.
- **Developer ID**: A reference to the developer responsible for creating the game.
- **Genre**: The genre or category to which the game belongs (e.g., action, adventure, puzzle).
- **Price**: The price of the game.
- **Release Date**: The date when the game was released.
- **Platform**: The platform(s) on which the game can be played (e.g., PC, Xbox, PlayStation).

## Functionality and Features
The DBMS for the game distribution platform will support various essential functionalities and features, including:

1. **Data Storage**: The system will provide a reliable and efficient method for storing and organizing game-related information.
2. **Data Retrieval**: Users will be able to search and retrieve games based on different criteria, such as title, genre, developer, or platform.
3. **Purchases and Receipts**: The DBMS will handle purchase transactions and generate receipts for users, storing relevant details such as purchase date, game ID, user ID, and payment information.
4. **User Accounts**: The system will manage user accounts, including registration, authentication, and storing user-specific information such as username, email, and password.
5. **Developer Management**: Developers will have dedicated profiles, allowing them to upload games, update information, and track sales and revenue.
6. **Genre Classification**: The DBMS will provide mechanisms to assign appropriate genre tags to each game and allow users to browse games by genre.
7. **Platform Compatibility**: The system will support tracking the compatibility of games with different platforms, ensuring accurate information is provided to users.

## Data Integrity and Security
To ensure data integrity and security within the DBMS, the following measures will be implemented:

1. **Data Validation**: Input validation techniques will be employed to prevent erroneous or inconsistent data from being stored in the database.
2. **Access Control**: Different user roles (e.g., administrators, developers, regular users) will have specific permissions and access levels to maintain data confidentiality and prevent unauthorized access.
3. **Backup and Recovery**: Regular backups of the database will be performed to mitigate the risk of data loss and allow for recovery in case of system failures or disasters.
4. **Encryption**: Sensitive user information and payment details will be encrypted to protect confidentiality during storage and transmission.

## Conclusion
The implementation of a DBMS for the game distribution platform will significantly improve data management and provide efficient operations for users, developers, and administrators. By storing game information, purchases, receipts, user accounts, developer details, and genre types in a structured manner, the DBMS will enhance the platform's functionality, user experience, and overall performance. It will enable seamless game discovery, streamlined transactions, and effective management of the platform's diverse range of games.
